This will assist your staff member to achieve a smooth transition into the new job.<br />
  When it comes to any questions or issues with regards to attendance compliance, working schedules, commissions and payroll this must only be addressed directly with the Client Staff Relations Team and must never be discussed with your staff member.<br />
  Shortly Remote Staff will be sending you your first month invoice that we expect to be paid on or before the first day of your staff member. We accept payments made through electronic bank transfers, direct debit and credit cards. <br />
