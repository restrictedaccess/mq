  <li>If you require for your Remote Staff contractor to make and or receive phone calls you will need to organize a VOIP or Skype phone account.</li>

<p> There are many VOIP suppliers for you to choose from, but if you wish to use Skype, to help you manage staff utilisation you should install a free version of Skype Manager (you must already have a Skype ID to do this). To view a quick step by step instruction on how to go about doing this and the costs associated please click <a href="http://www.remotestaff.com.au/skype_business_account.php">HERE</a>.</p>

  <li>As with any new staff member, the first 2 weeks of hire are crucial to building a successful long lasting working relationship. We expect that there will be a certain level of micromanagement and training conducted by you or your department manager(s). This will assist your staff member to achieve a smooth transition into the new job.</li><br />
  <li>When it comes to any questions or issues with regards to attendance compliance, working schedules, commissions and payroll this must only be addressed directly with the Client Staff Relations Team and must never be discussed with your staff member.</li><br />
  <li>Shortly Remote Staff will be sending you your first month invoice that we expect to be paid on or before the first day of your staff member. We accept payments made through electronic bank transfers, direct debit and credit cards. <br />
      <br />
    Succeeding invoices will be sent at the beginning of each month and are expected to be fully settled within 5 business days of the invoice date. This ensures that there are funds to cover your staff payments and enables Remote Staff to be a stable staff supplier for your business.</li><br />
  <li>At Remote Staff our goal is to partner with you over the long term and assist in any way we can to be successful in developing an offshore staffing strategy. An important component of that success is that your staff member is fully under your direction, guidance and management. At Remote Staff, we have no direct involvement when it comes to instructing staff on specific work related tasks. Any work related issues should be addressed directly to your staff member.<br />
